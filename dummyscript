# Things to consider
# - how the heck do we get the correct url's sent to sifu?
# - How do we provide an environment variable to the environment on creation?
# - If the edx platform is running, is the api still on port 8001 when on staging
# - What is the port number for edx platform when on staging?

# 1. aws cli needs to set
# 2. Check status of container repo in Oregon us-west-2
# 3. Create repo if it does not exist
# 4. Get docker-ecr login details
# 5. Make sure the image build is up to date
# 6. 

# Create a container repo if it does not exist
# get docker-ecr login credentials if needed
# if it exists, check if image exists
# If not or version outdated upload new image

# main dockerfile should not need any updating unless we are creating the repo for the frist time

#Create application with some settings

#Create Environment with some settings
# Check if the env var exists
eb create --envvars DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN=$DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN 

# if the environment already exists use it

# Check the env variable is also set

# if not set it

# Or use .ebextensions

# make sure application versions are cleaned
