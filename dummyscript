# Things to consider
# - how the heck do we get the correct url's sent to sifu?
# - How do we provide an environment variable to the environment on creation?
# - If the edx platform is running, is the api still on port 8001 when on staging
# - What is the port number for edx platform when on staging?

#Create application with some settings

#Create Environment with some settings
eb create --envvars DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN=$DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN 

# Or use .ebextensions
